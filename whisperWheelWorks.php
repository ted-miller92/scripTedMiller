                This is a website built for a local business owner.
            </p>
            <p>
                He wanted a simple website that would give a background of his business, 
                a description of services available, a list of dealers, brands and vendors, 
                and a simple contact form. 
                Having an online presence meant he could help prove 
                his legitimacy as a business to vendors and customers. 
            </p>

                I set up a document that we could each contribute to, 
                where I shared information about hosting and the logistics of creating a domain name. 
                I also prompted him to provide all the information he wanted on the website, 
                and we worked back and forth to divide and compile this information 
                into logical sections that eventually turned into the pages of the website.
