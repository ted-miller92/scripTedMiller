                From the moment I started coding, I have been excited and energized to work with people who want to promote their business. 
                Having an internet presence is essential these days, and making that presence useful and impactful is equally important.

                I have always loved building. Even in my spare time I can be caught working on my bicycle (more often than I actually ride it sometimes)
                and my passion for building and tinkering extends to my work. I also enjoy being outside, 
                listening to Tolkien lectures, trying new restaurants and cooking for the people I love.
